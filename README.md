## Chainlink CCP Rebase Token

**RBT is a rebase token(i.e a token whose token supply can change over time) written in Solidity.**

It allows us to among other things:
  - Incentivise users to deposit into a vault and get rewards
  - Encourage early adoption since the interest rate in the smart contract can only decrease
  - Each user will have their interest rate which is the global interest rate at the time of depositing
  - Interest rates will be inherited from the sender
